Table II: Statistical Significance Tests - Reproduction Status
======================================================================

STATUS: Cannot be properly reproduced

LIMITATIONS:
- Single training runs only (no replication)
- Missing evaluation data for some methods
- No experimental design for statistical comparison

REQUIREMENTS FOR REPRODUCTION:
- Multiple independent runs per algorithm (nâ‰¥5)
- Standardized evaluation protocol
- Proper experimental controls
